# Baseline Thermal and Performance Observations

This document records baseline thermal behavior observed during normal system operation.

The purpose is to establish reference points for future comparison during troubleshooting or hardware changes.


## Monitoring Tools

- NZXT CAM (CPU, liquid temperature, fan behavior)
- NVIDIA monitoring utilities (GPU temperature and load)
- Windows Task Manager (baseline system load)
- ASUS Armoury Crate (complete system monitoring)



## Observed Baseline Conditions

- System idle and light workload conditions monitored
- CPU, GPU, and liquid temperatures observed within comfortable and expected operating ranges
- Fan curves configured conservatively to prioritize noise control and component longevity

No thermal throttling or instability observed during monitoring.



## Configuration Notes

- CPU cooling managed via NZXT Kraken X AIO
- Fan curves configured using manufacturer-recommended profiles
- No manual overclocking or aggressive tuning applied



## Summary

Current thermal behavior is stable and consistent with expected performance for the hardware configuration.

This baseline serves as a reference for future diagnostics and system changes.
